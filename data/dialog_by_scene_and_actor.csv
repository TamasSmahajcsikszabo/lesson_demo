(:Text {content:  Have you heard of the Tox Uthat?})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 30})
(:Text {content:  I'm aware of the legend. It tells of a visitor from the future who left behind a mysterious device known as the Tox Uthat.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 30})
(:Text {content:  Essentially that story is correct.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 30})
(:Text {content:  Then the Uthat actually exists.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 30})
(:Text {content:  It was invented by a scientist named Kal Dano in the mid-twenty-seventh century. The Uthat is a quantum phase inhibitor... capable of halting all nuclear reaction within a star.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 30})

(:Text {content:  Then it's true.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 32})
(:Text {content:  I don't suppose you ever heard of Professor Samuel Estragon?})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 32})
"(:Text {content:  As a matter of fact, I have. He spent half his life searching for the Uthat. Archaeology is a hobby of mine.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 32})"

(:Text {content:  So you're continuing his work?})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 32})
(:Text {content:  Exactly.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 32})
(:Text {content:  With a Ferengi as an associate.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 32})
(:Text {content:  Sovak and I are definitely not working together.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 32})

(:Text {content:  At times he aided the professor in his explorations. Especially in situations that weren't quite ethical.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 32})

(:Text {content:  I take it you have a more noble purpose in mind.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 32})
(:Text {content:  I told the professor I'd present it to the Daystrom Institute. But first I have to find it. And that won't be easy with Sovak watching me every minute.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 32})
(:Text {content:  Then I'll go in your place.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 32})
(:Text {content:  And what about me?})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 32})
(:Text {content:  You'll remain here. It's safer.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 32})
"(:Text {content:  This isn't a starship, Jean-Luc. And I don't follow orders.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 32})"
(:Text {content:  You'd never find it without me. The professor's notes are in code.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 32})
(:Text {content:  From the moment we met I knew you were going to be trouble.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 32})
(:Text {content:  You look like a man who could handle trouble.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 32})
(:Text {content:  How far is it to our destination?})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 32})
"(:Text {content:  According to the professor's notes, a series of subterranrean caves lie twenty-nine kilometers due east. That's where we'll find the Uthat.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 32})"

(:Text {content:  Picard isn't quite so confident. He EXITS.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 32})
(:Text {content:  I expected such treachery. Did you think you could sneak away from me so easily?})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 34})
(:Text {content:  The disc -- where is it?})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 37})
(:Text {content:  Didn't anyone tell you weapons aren't allowed on Risa?})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 37})

(:Text {content:  That's not the way it happened.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 37})
(:Text {content:  She's a greedy and unscrupulous woman. A perfect mate for a Ferengi.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 37})
"(:Text {content:  You are becoming quite an annoyance, Sovak.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 37})"
"(:Text {content:  As are you, human. Perhaps I should kill you and then take the disc.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 37})"
(:Text {content:  No wait... you can have it.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 37})
"(:Text {content:  You see, I told you we'd make a good team.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 37})"
(:Text {content:  We have a long trip ahead of us.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 37})
(:Text {content:  So it finally begins.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 37})
(:Text {content:  Picard must not be allowed to destroy the Uthat.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 37})
(:Text {content:  He will surrender it to us... or die.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 37})
(:Text {content:  Have you calculated how much further we have to go?})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 38})
(:Text {content:  Another eleven kilometers.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 38})
(:Text {content:  We'll remain here for the night.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 38})
(:Text {content:  I was hoping you'd say that.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 38})
(:Text {content:  We made better time than I expected.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 38})
(:Text {content:  I'll take that as a compliment.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 38})
(:Text {content:  As it was intended.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 38})
(:Text {content:  Vash sits up -- moves closer to Picard. She hesitates})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 38})
(:Text {content:  Forgive me if I don't act surprised.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 38})
(:Text {content:  Sovak did pay me to hand over the disc.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 38})
(:Text {content:  Then you did steal it.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 38})
(:Text {content:  It wasn't stealing. The professor was dead... Someone had to continue his work. I had already devoted five years of my life to tracking down the Uthat.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 38})
(:Text {content:  But you took Sovak's money.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 38})
"(:Text {content:  It was the only way I could afford to get to Risa. As for Sovak, he got exactly what he deserved.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 38})"
"(:Text {content:  Well, any woman who can beat a Ferengi at his own game, bears watching.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 38})"
(:Text {content:  I'll take that as another compliment. I am flattered.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 38})
(:Text {content:  We should get some sleep.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 38})
"(:Text {content:  You know Jean-Luc, it's lucky for you we met.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 38})"
"(:Text {content:  If it wasn't for me, you'd still be back there sitting in the sun... relaxing.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 38})"
(:Text {content:  That happens to be why I came to Risa.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 38})
(:Text {content:  I'm sure you hated every minute of it. That kind of vacation isn't for a man like you. You need excitement.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 38})
(:Text {content:  Excitement? Sleeping in a damp cave... chasing after something we'll probably never find?})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 38})
"(:Text {content:  You are enjoying yourself, aren't you?})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 38})"
(:Text {content:  I suppose I am.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 38})
(:Text {content:  I just wanted to hear you say it.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 38})
(:Text {content:  Good. Now go to sleep.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 38})
(:Text {content:  I'll never forget that look on your face when you thought I was offering you Jamaharon.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 38})
(:Text {content:  That was a simple misunderstanding.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 38})
(:Text {content:  You did seem a little disappointed when I turned you down.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 38})
(:Text {content:  You can be the most irritating woman sometimes.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 38})
"(:Text {content:  You're kind of prickly yourself. Don't you see, we're a lot alike. That's probably why we get along so well.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 38})"

(:Text {content:  All right. We don't get along.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 38})
(:Text {content:  But you do admit we're attracted to one another.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 38})
(:Text {content:  Do I?})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 38})
"(:Text {content:  If you want to pretend otherwise, that's fine with me, but...})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 38})"
(:Text {content:  You still think I'm trouble?})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 38})
(:Text {content:  I'm sure of it.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 38})
(:Text {content:  This is it. We've reached the end of our journey.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 40})
(:Text {content:  Do you have an exact location?})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 40})
(:Text {content:  Six meters in from the large outcropping.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 40})

(:Text {content:  Is something wrong?})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 40})
(:Text {content:  I can't get a reading. There must be Starithium ore in these rocks.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 40})

(:Text {content:  Who the hell are they?})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 40})
(:Text {content:  They're security officers from the twenty-seventh century. They're here to take back the Uthat.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 40})
(:Text {content:  You knew about this and didn't tell me?})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 40})
"(:Text {content:  My apologies Vash... But if I had told you, would you have brought me here?})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 40})"
(:Text {content:  Probably not.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 40})
(:Text {content:  My point exactly.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 40})
(:Text {content:  So the betrayer is herself betrayed.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 40})

(:Text {content:  I see no reason to continue.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 42})
(:Text {content:  You will do as I say. Now pick up that shovel!})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 42})
"(:Text {content:  Look around Sovak, by now it must be obvious even to you... the Uthat is not here.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 42})"
(:Text {content:  Is this some pathetic attempt at trickery? Of course it's here. We simply haven't found it yet.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 42})
(:Text {content:  Are you saying the professor's findings were wrong?})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 42})
(:Text {content:  It would appear so.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 42})
(:Text {content:  But how could that be? His evidence was overwhelming.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 42})
(:Text {content:  Enough with this foolishness. Can't you see he's trying to deceive us? Return to work this instant!})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 42})
"(:Text {content:  I'm afraid he's right, Sovak. According to the disc we should have reached it hours ago.})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 43})"

(:Text {content:  I can't imagine anything that would be more offensive to a Vulcan. Their emotional detachment is the very core of their being. But why would it affect others aboard the ship?})-[:SAID]->(:Scene {id: 33A})
